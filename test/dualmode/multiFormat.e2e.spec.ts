 * Multi-Format Route E2E Tests
 *
 * NOTE: Multi-format support (multiFormatResponses) has been deprecated.
 * Use simplified dual-mode contracts with syncResponse instead.
 *
 * The previous tests verified verbose dual-mode contracts with multiple format handlers.
 * This functionality has been removed in favor of a simpler single sync handler approach.
